% The style file configures the cover and title page headers to
% include only the faculty name and the department name.
% Along with the macros required by the locale file interface,
% the locale files need to define the following strings:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item\texttt{facultyLongName} -- The name of the faculty
%     combined with the name of the university.
% \end{itemize}
%    \begin{macrocode}

% \begin{macro}{\thesis@blocks@frontMatter}

% of the front matter of the thesis. The page numbering is arabic
% in accordance with the formal requirements of the faculty.
